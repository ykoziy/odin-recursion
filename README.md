# The Odin Project Recursion
The Odin Project, recursion exercises. Because in order to understand recursion you must first understand recursion.

## Assignment 1

- Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

- Now write another method fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

## Assignment 2
Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

Tips:
- Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).

- It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.
